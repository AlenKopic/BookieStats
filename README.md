## Environment:

### Prerequisites
1. make sure that you have a working Java installation. Play requires Java 5 or later.
2. Java IDE (i.e. IntelliJ)
3. mongoDB

### Installing the Play framework
Just download the latest binary package from the download page and unzip it to any path. If youâ€™re using Windows, it is generally a good idea to avoid space characters in the path, so for example c:\Play would be a better choice than c:\Documents And Settings\user\play.
